# cmd-line-spreadsheets-toolkit

The Command Line Spreadsheets Toolkit.

This repository aims to develop documentation and tools for how to interact
with spreadsheets on the
[command line interface (“CLI”)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface)
of Unix-like systems such as Linux. By command line we do not mean
[“terminal user interface” (TUI)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text-based_user_interface)
which means that one invokes a full terminal spreadsheet program such as
[“GNU Oleo”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Oleo) or
[sc](https://github.com/dkastner/sc), but rather a way to generate,
manipulate and chart simple spreadsheets semi-automatically and
directly on the Unix command line.
